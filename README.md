# KickStarter-Success-Prediction
This project is all about predicting whether a start-up project will succeed before itâ€™s released based on data collected on it from the KickStarter website and basic information about the project like the project name, country of origin, category, etc... This project is a fulfilment to the CMP4011 BD project.
